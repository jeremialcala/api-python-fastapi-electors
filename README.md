# CNE Elector Inquiry (api-python-fastapi-electors)

API that gets elector data from the National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE)

We are building an API that inquires about electors from the national council site. This API will be developed in Python using FastAPI as the REST framework. For now, our API will get elector data from the National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE), given a national ID number and type, and will find if this person has a valid registration to vote and where is the poll center for this citizen.

Our API uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a php service response with this citizen poll site information.

The unique endpoint is a @GET of the resource elector.

**Path:** /elector

**Method:** @GET
